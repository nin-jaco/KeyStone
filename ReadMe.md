Calculating Fibonacci:
The most memory efficient should always be the formulae converted into an efficient code expression. 

No iterations are kept in memory, a calculation is performed and returned based on an input.

On higher numbers, other datatypes can be used for precision.



Overall:
1. There is support for Python in Visual Studio, allowing me to marry the two in one IDE that i am very comfortable in.
2. These various type of projects are hosted in DevOps using GitHub as a code repositry.  If we are to host the results in a dashboard, it can be hosted in Azure from here.
3. DevOps is the new thing since sliced cheese :).  So many possibilities and integrations.
