We are going on the premise of the function being memory efficient, not speed. It depends also on the size of 'n'

I would assume the golden ratio to be most direct, that is why the project has changed somewhat, this is also without deviation, sqrt(5) is an approximate. Infinite looping will result in a stack overflow exception.  The Eigen Value on (http://www.oranlooney.com/post/fibonacci/) also seems viable for this end but is using a 64-bit floating point arithmetic with a possible will drawback that Python will never be able to precisely represent more than 15 decimal digits.

Now my head wants to explode :)
